- Efficient binary serialization with bincode

## Original PRD
- PixelChangeCheck:
PCC is a framework that compares the current frame to the last frame and only sends the data if it has changed. For example, if someone is staying on an unmoving page, the client WON'T send new data, until some pixels are changed. The server will keep rendering the last frame given, indefinitely. The client will send periodic “keep-alive” requests to the server, telling it that the connection has not ended. If only small amounts of pixels are changed, it will only resend those pixels/data for the server to change, For example, if a small button changed color, it will only resend the data for the changed pixels. This expands to larger parts. For example an embedded youtube video in a slideshow. It will keep the background of the slideshow, and maybe even some parts of the video that haven't changed, but it will send the new/changed parts of the video.
